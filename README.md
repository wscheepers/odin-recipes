This practice is showing the first steps I learned about HTML from TOP. This project contains a basic page of some recipes, with all the knowledge I learned so far. Some things that it will showe are:
- GIT & GITHUB: making a repo, commits and push it to the server.
- making a new file in VS, and have a good structure.
- HTML: template, header, body, font styles, links and images

Note: the page will not contain any CSS.
