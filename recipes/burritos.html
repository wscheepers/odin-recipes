    <p><strong>Directions</strong></p>
    
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Place a skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir ground beef, 1/2 cup chopped onion, and garlic in the hot skillet until beef is browned and crumbly, breaking it apart as it cooks, about 8 minutes; drain excess grease. Mix in 1/2 of the can diced tomatoes, Worcestershire sauce, chili powder, paprika, oregano, 3/4 teaspoon cumin, and black pepper. Bring meat mixture to a boil over medium-high heat and cook for 5 minutes, stirring often.</li>
        <li>Heat refried beans and remaining 1/4 teaspoon cumin in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Keep beans warm. Mix remaining diced tomatoes, beef gravy, and enchilada sauce in a separate saucepan; bring to a boil.</li>
        <li>Place tortillas onto a microwave-safe plate and cover with a damp paper towel; microwave tortillas until they are soft and warm, about 30 seconds.</li>
        <li>Place warmed tortilla onto a work surface and spoon 1/4 of the beef mixture in a line down the center. Layer 1/4 of the bean mixture on top of beef layer and spread 1/4 cup of the Cheddar cheese over the bean layer. Fold right and left edges of tortilla over the ends of the filling and roll up tortilla to make a burrito. Place burrito, seam side down, into a 9x13-inch baking dish. Repeat with remaining tortillas to make 4 burritos.</li>
        <li>Pour gravy sauce over burritos in the baking dish; top with remaining 1 cup Cheddar cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake burritos in the preheated oven until cheese has melted, 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>To serve, place each burrito on a serving plate and spoon sauce from baking dish over burrito. Top each burrito with 1/4 cup sour cream, remaining chopped onion, and chopped tomato. Finish each with 1/4 cup chopped lettuce.</li>
    </ol>
